## FAQ

### 1. What is the required fish version?

fisherman was built for fish >= 2.3.0. If you are using 2.2.0, append the following code to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` for [snippet](#8-what-is-a-plugin) support.

```fish
for file in ~/.config/fish/conf.d/*.fish
    source $file
end
```

### 2. How do I use fish as my default shell?

Add fish to the list of login shells in `/etc/shells` and make it your default shell.

```sh
echo "/usr/local/bin/fish" | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
```

### 3. How do I uninstall fisherman?

Run

```fish
fisher self-uninstall
```

### 4. Is fisherman compatible with oh my fish themes and plugins?

Yes.

### 5. Where does fisherman put stuff?

fisherman goes in `~/.config/fish/functions/fisher.fish`.

The cache and plugin configuration is created in `~/.cache/fisherman` and `~/.config/fisherman` respectively.

The fishfile is saved to `~/.config/fish/fishfile`.

### 6. What is a fishfile and how do I use it?

The fishfile `~/.config/fish/fishfile` lists all the installed plugins.

You can let fisherman take care of this file for you automatically, or write in the plugins you want and run `fisher` to satisfy the changes.

```
fisherman/simple
fisherman/z
omf/thefuck
omf/grc
```

This mechanism only installs plugins and missing dependencies. To remove a plugin, use `fisher rm` instead.

### 7. Where can I find a list of fish plugins?

Browse the [organization] or use the [online] search to discover content.

### 8. What is a plugin?

A plugin is:

1. a directory or git repo with a function `.fish` file either at the root level of the project or inside a `functions` directory

2. a theme or prompt, i.e, a `fish_prompt.fish`, `fish_right_prompt.fish` or both files

3. a snippet, i.e, one or more `.fish` files inside a directory named `conf.d` that are evaluated by fish at the start of the shell

### 9. How can I list plugins as dependencies to my plugin?

Create a new `fishfile` file at the root level of your project and write in the plugin dependencies.

```fish
owner/repo
https://github.com/dude/sweet
https://gist.github.com/bucaran/c256586044fea832e62f02bc6f6daf32
```

### 10. What about fundle?

fundle inspired me to use a bundle file, but it still has limited capabilities and requires you to modify your fish configuration.
